# text-utils

I have started learning Django. 
So, this is my first project made using Python and Django. 
It is a simple test-analyzer which can:
  1. Remove Punctuations
  2. Convert text into UpperCase.
  3. Remove New Lines.
  4. Remove all the Spaces.
  5. Remove Extra Spaces if any(if presented with only one space than it won't remove it).
  6. Gives you a count of the characters.

## The navigation bar is just for the sake of Looks of the webpage.

You can toggle one or all options available depending on your interest and need.
